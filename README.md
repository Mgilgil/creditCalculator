# Credit Calculator  

This project was created as part of my university coursework.  
It allows students to enter the credits they received during the year, validates each input, and then determines the final outcome.  

---

## Features  

- Input credit values with **validation** for each entry  
- Display the **result** clearly on screen  
- Save the result automatically to a `.txt` file  
- Generate an **overall histogram** of student outcomes using Pythonâ€™s graphics library
